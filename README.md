# Extended-Info-Plugin
Teamspeak TS 3 Plugin

Old versions until 2.2 only work up to Teamspeak 3 Client 3.0.19.4.

New versions from 2.3 on are written in python for the pyTSon plugin by [@pathmann](http://github.com/pathmann).

###That means all new versions require you to install [pyTSon](http://github.com/pathmann/pyTSon/releases) before using this plugin!
